Simply love noteskin for stepmania 5 (with pump it up and techno mode)

This is my first noteskin port. 

It is based on hurtpiggypig's noteskin: http://r21freak.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=25893#p376993
And also on hanubeki's noteskin as a base for the sm5 port: https://github.com/hanubeki/noteskin-hanubeki/tree/5.0-final

I don't really know how to make a noteskin but this one turned out great :) 
Huge thanks for hurtpiggypig for the nice design and hanubeki for the easy to understand codes :) 

The skin falls back to hanubeki's skin for unsupported notes.

The new sexy noteskin:
